                  My work-related experience is centered around technical
                  consulting, academic advisement, youth development, retail,
                  management, and customer service. Being a Mobile Expert/Apple
                  Master introduced technical support to my repertoire only to
                  be enhanced after becoming a Geek Squad Agent shortly after
                  increasing my skill set with troubleshooting, software
                  repairs, device set ups, and data transfers. As an University
                  Peer Academic Coach at Fayetteville State University, I
                  specialized in time management, goal orientation,
                  individualized lesson planning, and tips in various academic
                  areas (math, writing/essays, etc). I gained experience in
                  youth development while serving as Vice President of a
                  nonprofit mentoring, R.O.O.T.S (Regiment Of Overriding The
                  Statistics). R.O.O.T.S primary focus was exposing at-risk
                  youth to beneficial alternative routes after graduation from
                  high school. I've received retail, customer service, and
                  management experience from Journey Kidz serving as a part-time
                  sales associate then promoted to Sales Lead/Key Holder. My
                  academic achievements consist of graduating from Cross Creek
                  Early College High School with 66 college credits, becoming a
                  McNair Scholar researcher where I focused on Stereotype Threat
                  and African American English in Academic Setting and how the
                  two factors influence academic performance. I received my
                  Bachelor's Degree in Psychology From Fayetteville State
                  University. I transitioned from the professor track to become
                  a full-stack software developer which started at App Academy.
                  At App Academy I aquired a repertoire that includes: |
                  JavaScript | Node | Express | Sequelize | SQLAlchemy | React |
                  Redux | HTML | CSS | Python | Flask. With this repertoire I
                  was able to create three full stack web applications...
